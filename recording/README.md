# Audio Recording Example

This example demonstrates audio recording to a microSD card on Sonatino.

It records 10-second audio clips and saves them as WAV files to the microSD card. The LED blinks red while recording. When a clip is saved, it blinks blue for a short time, then resumes recording the next clip.

Filenames follow the format `REC_XXXX.wav`, where `XXXX` is a 4-digit number starting with 0001.
